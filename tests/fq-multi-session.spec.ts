// tests/fq-multi-session.spec.ts
//
// The end-to-end journey the migration exists to make possible:
//
//   create a session -> FIND -> streamed result -> ask a follow-up ->
//   create a SECOND session -> switch -> assert isolation -> reload -> restore ->
//   open history -> reopen an archived session
//
// This replaces `tests/e2e.spec.ts`, which drove `invoke('run_deep_quant_analysis')` through a
// stubbed Tauri IPC bridge and cited `src-tauri/src/quant/mod.rs`. The desktop shell is gone and that
// file does not exist, so the old spec tested an architecture that no longer ships.
//
// WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS STUBBED
// --------------------------------
// Real: the production Next build, the same-origin `/api/deepquant/*` proxy, the HMAC identity chain
// (cookie -> /users/me -> assertion -> server-side verification), the FastAPI service, the SQLite
// session store, write-through stream persistence, ownership checks, and the SSE assembler.
//
// Stubbed: the LangGraph graph (canned frames — see `agents/deep-quant-loop/e2e_stub_server.py`) and
// the auth API's `/users/me` (see `tests/support/stub-identity.mjs`).
//
// So this proves the session/streaming/isolation/persistence WIRING. It proves nothing about model
// quality, prompt behaviour, market data, or the real price-trigger watcher. Those stay manual.
