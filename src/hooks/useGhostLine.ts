 * Pure helper: decide which failed-to-remove ids are still worth retrying and

 * Background: `removeEntity` can throw transiently (e.g. a shape still being
 * committed). Retrying on the next redraw self-heals those. But after a widget
 * teardown/recreate, ids from the dead widget are permanently invalid on the
 * new chart, so `removeEntity` throws on EVERY pass. Without bounding, those
 * dead ids live in `entityIdsRef.current` forever, warn on every redraw, and
 * can transiently let a new run clear a prior run's still-valid segments via
 * the shared ref. We therefore drop an id after `maxAttempts` consecutive
 * failures.
 *
 * Contract:
 *   - `failed`    — ids returned by `removeGhostSegments` this pass (each is
 *                   one more consecutive failure for that id).
 *   - `attempts`  — running per-id consecutive-failure counts. MUTATED in
 *                   place: incremented for every `failed` id, and entries are
 *                   deleted for ids that are dropped or that are not failed
 *                   this pass (a successful remove resets the counter).
 *   - `allTracked`— the full set of ids currently tracked in the ref, so we
 *                   can reset the attempt counter for ids that were NOT in
 *                   `failed` (i.e. they removed successfully this pass). May be
 *                   omitted when the caller handles resets itself.
 *   - returns     — the subset of `failed` still worth retrying (attempt count
 *                   < maxAttempts). An id that has failed `maxAttempts`
 *                   consecutive times is dropped from `attempts` and NOT
