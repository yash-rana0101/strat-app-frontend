// FastAPI service (`agents/deep-quant-loop`, :8086).
//
// Browser analogue of `commands/deep_quant.rs`. Serves the agent lifecycle
// (`/run`, `/resume`, `/qa`, `/cancel`, `/stream/{thread_id}`) and the F&O
// snapshot endpoint (`/options/snapshot`).
//
// STREAMING IS LOAD-BEARING. `/run`, `/qa` and `/stream/*` are SSE: the Python
// side holds the connection open and pushes glass-box frames as the graph
// executes. `infra/caddy/Caddyfile` sets `flush_interval -1` on /deepquant/* for
// this reason, and this handler must not buffer either — it passes the upstream
// `ReadableStream` through untouched with `no-transform` and no timeout.
