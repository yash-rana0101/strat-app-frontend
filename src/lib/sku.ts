/**
 * SKU model — the TERMINAL / RESEARCH product split.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Under the SEBI Research Analyst regulations, publishing a directional
 * recommendation (buy/sell, entry, target, stop) is a regulated activity that
 * requires registration. Publishing market *analytics* — charts, indicators,
 * regime classification, volume profile, validating arithmetic on numbers the
 * user supplied themselves — is not.
 *
 * The product therefore splits into two SKUs:
 *
 *   TERMINAL  Unregulated analytics. Charts, Ghost Lines, footprint, volume
 *             profile, indicators, regime, VWEPR, S/R, patterns, and the VERIFY
 *             validator. Sellable today, no registration required.
 *
 *   RESEARCH  Regulated research output. FIND, DEBATE, conviction score, the
 *             journal, and Q&A. Requires the RA registration (INH) and a KYC'd
 *             subscriber.
 *
 * Nothing here removes a feature. It gates who may reach the recommendation
 * surface. See `docs/business/PLAN_OF_ACTION.md` §4.2 blocker P1.
 *
 * DESIGN CONSTRAINTS
 * ------------------
 * 1. Every function in this module is PURE and reads no environment variables.
 *    `computeFeatureAccess` in `./featureFlags` deliberately unlocks everything
 *    when `!IS_PROD`, which is fine for premium UI polish but would make a
 *    compliance gate untestable and unprovable. Enforcement state is a separate,
 *    explicitly-passed input — see `skuEnforcementEnabled()`.
 *
 * 2. Resolution FAILS CLOSED. Absent, null, or malformed entitlement data
 *    yields TERMINAL, never RESEARCH.
 *
 * 3. This module is defence in depth and a UX affordance ONLY. It runs on the
 *    user's machine and is therefore not a security boundary. The authoritative
 *    gate is server-side in `agents/deep-quant-loop/entitlements.py`, which the
 *    user cannot bypass. Never treat a client-side pass as authorisation.

 * offers it — which is exactly why the gate must live at the API layer and not

/**
 * Whether SKU enforcement is active in this build.
 *
 * Separate from the pure functions above so the gate can be exercised in dev
 * without shipping a build where the gate is silently off. Enforced in prod
 * automatically; `NEXT_PUBLIC_SKU_ENFORCE=true` turns it on locally.
 *
 * Read `IS_PROD` lazily rather than importing it at module scope: `lib/env.ts`
 * throws when `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` is unset, and the pure exports of this
 * module must stay importable in a bare unit-test environment.
 *
 * ── The closed-beta opt-out ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_RESEARCH_BETA_OPEN=true` disables the gate even in a production
 * build. It exists so a CLOSED beta group can exercise the recommendation
 * surface, and it is a deliberate, named switch rather than the alternative that
 * was considered — setting `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROD=false` on a live deployment. That
 * would have worked (this function ORs the two) but it would leave the box
 * asserting it is not production, which is false, unreviewable, and would mislead
 * the next person reading the compose file.
 *
 * ⚠ COMPLIANCE, not convenience. Turning this on publishes directional
 * recommendations — buy/sell, entry, target, stop — which SEBI treats as a
 * regulated activity requiring Research Analyst registration. It is defensible
 * for a closed, invite-only tester group; it is NOT defensible once sign-up is
 * open to the public. The three conditions that make it acceptable:
 *
 *   1. access is invite-only — no open registration;
 *   2. the AI-disclosure and risk copy stays visible on those surfaces;
 *   3. it is removed before public launch.
 *
 * This is still only an affordance. The authoritative gate is
 * `agents/deep-quant-loop/entitlements.py` (`SKU_ENFORCE`), which the user
 * cannot bypass — and which is separately OFF today because the remote
 * entitlement endpoint does not exist yet.
