 * successfully was accepted as an `OrderBookState`, so a `{}`, a null-ish object,
 * or an entry written by an earlier version of this schema set `book` to something
 * with no `asks`/`bids`. The very next render then ran `book.asks.filter(...)` and
 * threw `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filter')`.
 * Because that happens during render, and the sidebar has no error boundary of its

 * re-expanding the order book (which remounts this component).
 *
