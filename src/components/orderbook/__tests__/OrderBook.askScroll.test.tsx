/**
 * OrderBook — the ask ladder must be a working scroll container.
 *
 * The reported bug: the green (bid) ladder scrolled, the red (ask) ladder did
 * not, and its topmost rows were clipped with no way to reach them.
 *
 * The cause was CSS, not data. The ask container was
 * `flex flex-col justify-end ... overflow-y-auto`. When a flex container uses
 * `justify-content: flex-end` and its content overflows, the overflow happens
 * past the BLOCK-START (top) edge — and `scrollTop` cannot go below 0, so those
 * rows are unreachable in every major browser. The bid container never had
 * `justify-end`, which is precisely why one side worked and the other didn't.
 * Bottom alignment now comes from an auto margin on an inner wrapper, which
 * resolves to 0 once the content overflows and so leaves scrolling intact.
 *
 * jsdom performs no layout, so it cannot observe the actual clipping. What it CAN
 * pin is the class contract that caused it — that the ask ladder never again
 * combines `overflow-y-auto` with `justify-end`, and that both ladders scroll
 * the same way. That is the regression this file exists to catch.
