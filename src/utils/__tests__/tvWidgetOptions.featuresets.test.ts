// What the vendored charting library will and will not accept.
//
// TradingView IGNORES an unknown featureset silently. No warning, no error — the
// feature simply never appears, which is indistinguishable from the library not
// supporting it. That makes a wrong name here one of the more expensive mistakes
// available: you go hunting through CSS, container sizes and widget editions
// before suspecting the string.
//
// The names are therefore checked against the vendored `charting_library.d.ts`,
// which declares the authoritative unions. Reading the real type definition rather
// than a copy means this cannot drift on a library upgrade.
//
// The finding that prompted this file: the 1–8 pane layout grid (`header_layouttoggle`
// / `support_multicharts`) is gated by featuresets in `TradingTerminalFeatureset`
// — the Trading Platform edition — while we vendor Advanced Charts. It LOOKS
// available, because `setLayout`, `chartsCount` and `MultipleChartsLayoutType`'s 40
// arrangements are declared in the shared type definitions and the "Select layout"
// / "Sync in layout" strings ship in `bundles/library.*.js`. The type definitions
// and localisation assets are shared across editions; the featureset unions are
// what actually differ.

 *
 *   · `load_last_chart` is long-standing and widely documented; the union may
 *     simply not enumerate every legacy name, and the app relies on it for chart
 *     persistence. Removing it on the strength of this parse would be a guess.
 *   · the `chart_style_*` entries other than `hilo` name chart types (Renko, Kagi,
 *     P&F, Line Break, TPO, SVP, volume candles, volume footprint) that this build
 *     declares no featureset for at all — only `chart_style_hilo` and
 *     `chart_style_hilo_last_price` exist. Those are very likely doing nothing.
 *
 * Both need checking against the running widget, not a `.d.ts`. Pinning the set
 * means a NEW unknown name fails immediately while these stay visible as a
 * question rather than being silently blessed.
