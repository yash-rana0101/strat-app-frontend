# frontend/Dockerfile — the hosted website (app.stratai.live)
#
# Build context is ./frontend (NOT the monorepo root, unlike agents/sentiment
# which needs shared_protos/). See frontend/.dockerignore — the root
# .dockerignore does not apply to this context.
#
#   docker-compose.prod.yml sets:
#     build:
#       context: ./frontend
#       dockerfile: Dockerfile
#
# Two things here are load-bearing rather than preference:
#
#   1. `next build --turbopack`. The default webpack production build dies with
#      `FATAL ERROR: Committing semi space failed` partway through compiling this
#      tree. The exhaustion is in EXTERNAL memory, not the JS heap, so raising
#      --max-old-space-size does not help (tried at 8 GB). See next.config.ts.
#
#   2. The NEXT_PUBLIC_* values are build ARGs, not runtime env. Next inlines them
#      into the JS bundle textually at build time, so setting them in `environment:`
#      has no effect whatsoever — the container would serve a bundle compiled
#      against whatever was present when the image was built. The feature kill
#      switches deliberately do NOT appear here: they are unprefixed and read at
#      request time (see app/api/_featureSwitches.ts), which is exactly what keeps
#      them out of the bundle and makes them restart-configurable.
#
# Node 22, not the repo's usual node:20-alpine (agents/sentiment/Dockerfile).
# Node 20 reached end-of-life in April 2026; this is the only container in the
# stack terminating public HTTP, so it should not run an unsupported runtime.
