## Version 32.1.0

*Date: Mon Aug 17 2026*

**New Features**

- **Added featureset that lets users pin a tooltip open by clicking the mark.** Enable the [`pin_bar_mark_tooltips_on_click`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#pin_bar_mark_tooltips_on_click) featureset to let users pin any bar mark tooltip — plain text or custom — by clicking the mark.
- **Added support for custom timescale mark tooltips.** Timescale marks can now display fully custom tooltip content rendered by your own web component.
Provide the new [`customTooltip`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.TimescaleMark#customtooltip) property on a mark and register the `tv-custom-timescale-mark` element via [`custom_js_urls`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.TradingTerminalWidgetOptions#custom_js_urls) widget option.
Refer to the [Customize mark tooltips](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/how-to-guides/customize-mark-tooltips) guide for details and a complete example. (Trading Platform only)
- **Added support for custom bar mark tooltips and click-to-pin.** Bar marks now support the same web-component tooltips as timescale marks.
Provide the new [`customTooltip`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.Mark#customtooltip) property on a mark and register a `tv-custom-bar-mark` element via [`custom_js_urls`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.TradingTerminalWidgetOptions#custom_js_urls).
Refer to the [Customize mark tooltips](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/how-to-guides/customize-mark-tooltips) guide for details. (Trading Platform only)
- **Added the `show_buy_sell_buttons_on_unsupported_resolution` featureset.** When the [`show_buy_sell_buttons_on_unsupported_resolution`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#show_buy_sell_buttons_on_unsupported_resolution)
featureset is enabled, switching to a resolution that the current symbol does
not support no longer marks the instrument as non-tradable, so the Buy/Sell
buttons remain visible. The symbol itself is still resolved and tradable in
this case; only the requested interval is unavailable. The featureset is
disabled by default, and the buttons are hidden when the chart cannot display
data. (Trading Platform only)
- **Added the ability to collapse and expand Watchlist sections.** Clicking a section header now hides or shows the symbols grouped under it, and the collapsed state is preserved across page reloads.
Creating and collapsing sections are both controlled by the `watchlist_sections` featureset, which is enabled by default. (Trading Platform only)
- **Added the `tradedSourcesVisibility` method to the Trading Host.** The [`tradedSourcesVisibility`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Broker.IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost#tradedsourcesvisibility)
method returns a watched value that shows or hides all trading sources on the chart — order and
position lines and execution marks. Setting the value to `false` temporarily hides them on all
charts without affecting the persisted chart settings. It is the same value that is toggled by
the *Hide positions and orders* option in the right toolbar. (Trading Platform only)

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed incorrect market status when the user's machine clock is misconfigured.** The automatically-calculated market status now uses the synced server time
instead of the browser's local clock. Previously, if the user's machine clock
was wrong, the market status (for example, the `current_session` value exposed
through `marketStatus()`) could show the market as closed while it was open, or
vice versa. When the datafeed implements
[`getServerTime`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IDatafeedChartApi#getservertime),
the status is now computed from that synced time; otherwise behavior is
unchanged.
- **Fixed an issue where a `time_frames` entry with a tick or seconds resolution and no `description` broke the date range toolbar.** A [`time_frames`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.ChartingLibraryWidgetOptions#time_frames) item that used a tick (for example, `"1T"`) or seconds (for example, `"1S"`) resolution without a [`description`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.TimeFrameItem#description) crashed the date range toolbar. The generated label now supports tick and seconds resolutions, so `description` remains optional for all resolution types.
- **Fixed the Heikin-Ashi price line disappearing when real prices are shown on the price scale.** On a Heikin-Ashi chart with `mainSeriesProperties.haStyle.showRealLastPrice` enabled, the horizontal last-price line and its price-scale label now render at the real last price. Previously, with datafeeds that serve plain OHLCV bars (the typical case), the line silently failed to draw and the label was hidden.
- **Fixed a broken series after calling `load` with an undefined state.** Previously, calling [`load`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartingLibraryWidget#load) with an `undefined` or invalid state used to disconnect the chart data sessions without restoring them. This left the series permanently blank even though the datafeed kept providing data. The method now ignores such calls before any teardown happens: a descriptive error is logged and the current chart state is left untouched.
- **Fixed a crash when switching chart types with a Volume Profile indicator on the chart.** Rapidly switching between chart types (for example, starting from Renko) while a
Volume Profile indicator was on the chart could throw a `TypeError` and leave the
chart unresponsive. Indicators that depend on the visible range stop themselves as
soon as their inputs become invalid, and doing so while the chart data was being
recalculated left the recalculation half-applied. Such indicators are now skipped
correctly, and the chart finishes updating as expected.
- **Fixed the `emoji` option being ignored when creating emoji drawings.** The option passed to [`createMultipointShape`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createmultipointshape) and [`createShape`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createshape) is now correctly applied.
  - Use the emoji character directly (e.g., `'😂'`). For more information, see [Drawing overrides](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/overrides/Drawings-Overrides#emojis).
  - Invalid emoji values now log a warning instead of silently falling back to the default emoji.
- **Fixed the Moving Average Adaptive indicator producing extreme values on Renko charts.** On chart types whose prices snap to a fixed grid — such as Renko or Point & Figure — the
indicator could diverge to values many orders of magnitude away from the price. Its
smoothing factor is now bounded, so the plot stays within the price range on these chart
types as well as on symbols with very low volatility.
- **Fixed frozen countdown to bar close and clock.** Previously, time-based UI elements froze after initial load: the bottom toolbar clock stopped advancing, and the countdown to bar close only updated on price ticks. Real-time updates are now restored across all affected features, including the timezone clock, bar close countdown, market status, futures contract expiration countdown, and order timestamps.
- **Fixed the VWAP indicator anchor periods for symbols whose trading day starts on the previous calendar day.** On an intraday resolution, the `Week`, `Month`, `Quarter`, `Year`, `Decade`, and `Century` anchor periods used calendar dates instead of trading days. This placed overnight bars into the wrong period and reset VWAP at midnight instead of session start. The anchor period now uses the bar's trading day. It also requests all necessary data from the start of the session.
- **Fixed the Anchored VWAP drawing starting from the bar next to the selected one.** The Anchored VWAP drawing now starts on the bar it is anchored to. Previously, the anchor bar produced no value, so the line visually began one bar later and the bar was also excluded from the volume-weighted accumulation, which made all the following values slightly inaccurate.
- **Saving a chart layout while a drawing is still being created no longer breaks that layout.** Previously, calling [`save`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartingLibraryWidget#save) during drawing creation stored it without points. Restoring such a layout created invisible drawings that couldn't be removed, and for `parallel_channel`, threw an error that lost all subsequent drawings and indicators. Unfinished drawings are now excluded from saved layouts, drawings without points are skipped on restore, and `parallel_channel` no longer throws an error during creation.
- **The "Make copy of chart layout" dialog is no longer pre-filled with the literal text "\{title} copy" for unsaved layouts.** The dialog opened by [`showSaveAsChartDialog`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartingLibraryWidget#showsaveaschartdialog) now has an empty name input when the current chart layout has never been saved. Previously, the input was pre-filled with the literal placeholder text "\{title} copy" because there was no layout name to substitute. Saved layouts still get the "&lt;layout name&gt; copy" suggestion.
- **Fixed console errors and chart blinking when Date Range Sync was used in a multi-chart layout with different resolutions.** The sync engine now correctly handles charts with no data or limited history, preventing redundant data requests and unhandled promise rejections. (Trading Platform only)
- **Fixed order type tabs not being shown when modifying an order.** The Market, Limit, and Stop tabs in the Order Ticket are shown again when an existing order is opened for modification and the broker enables [`supportModifyOrderType`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.BrokerConfigFlags#supportmodifyordertype). Previously the tabs were always hidden in this case, so the order type could not be changed. (Trading Platform only)
- **Fixed missing bracket properties in the custom `showPositionDialog` handler.** The [`brackets`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Broker.Brackets) argument passed to
[`showPositionDialog`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Broker.BrokerCustomUI#showpositiondialog)
now also contains `guaranteedStop` and `trailingStopPips`, so a custom order
ticket can read the new value when the user drags a trailing-stop or
guaranteed-stop order on the chart. (Trading Platform only)
- **Fixed the order quantity on the chart not being clickable.** Hovering over the quantity of a working order on the chart shows the _Modify_ button again, so the order can be edited without using the right-click menu or the Account Manager. The control is displayed when the broker enables [`supportEditAmount`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Broker.BrokerConfigFlags#supporteditamount). (Trading Platform only)

**Documentation**

- **Added Markdown versions of the documentation pages for AI assistants.** Every documentation page is now also published as plain Markdown at its own URL
with an `.md` suffix, so a page can be fed to an AI assistant without scraping
HTML.
  - Each page shows *Copy as Markdown* and *View as Markdown* controls under its
  title.
  - The docs root serves `llms.txt` with the list of all pages and
  `docs_map.md` with a full page map including headings.
  - The TypeScript definition files are hosted next to the docs and always match
  the documented version. Links to them are available on the API Reference
  overview page.
- **Improved readability of the API Reference pages.** Signatures now carry badges that mark deprecated, recommended, optional, and
read-only members, so it is clear at a glance which overload to use and which
interface methods an implementation has to provide. Deprecation notices appear
directly under the affected signature and structural headings are de-emphasized to reduce visual noise.
- **New article.** [Indicator placement](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/indicators/indicator-placement)
explains how the library selects a pane and a price scale for an indicator, documents the
`forceOverlay` parameter and every value of the `priceScale` option, and describes how to move
an indicator to another pane.

## Version 32.0.0

*Date: Wed Jul 01 2026*

**Breaking Changes**

- **Changed return values for `dataReady`, `setChartType`, and `saveChartToServer`.** Calling these methods without callbacks now returns a promise instead of the previous fire-and-forget behavior.
  - `widget.activeChart().dataReady()` without arguments now returns `Promise<boolean>` instead of a synchronous boolean. Use `await widget.activeChart().dataReady()` when waiting for data to load, or migrate synchronous readiness checks to an explicit synchronous state check such as `widget.activeChart().getSeries().barsCount() > 0`.
  - `widget.activeChart().setChartType(type)` now returns `Promise<void>` and rejects with an `Error` if the chart type change cannot load data. The deprecated callback overload keeps the previous callback behavior.
  - `widget.saveChartToServer()` called without arguments now returns a `Promise<void>` that rejects with a `SaveChartError` when saving fails. Previously such a call ignored failures, so handle the returned promise to avoid unhandled rejections. Calls that pass `onComplete`/`onFail` callbacks keep the previous behavior.
- **Renamed drawing tool names in `custom_translate_function` and `drawings_access`.** The `originalText` argument passed to [`custom_translate_function`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.ChartingLibraryWidgetOptions#custom_translate_function) now reflects the updated tool names (for example, `"trendline"` instead of `"Trend Line"`). The `name` values in the `tools` array of [`drawings_access`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.ChartingLibraryWidgetOptions#drawings_access) follow the same new naming (for example, `"Trendline"` instead of `"Trend Line"`).
- **Removed the Anchored Text drawing tool from the left panel.** Use the *Text* tool with the *Anchor* option switched on to get the same results.

**New Features**

- **Added countdown support for DWM resolutions.** The countdown to bar close can now be displayed for daily, weekly, and monthly resolutions.
- **Added the `workers` widget option for worker-based chart calculations and processing.** Use the `workers.enabled` widget constructor option to let the library run chart calculations and processing, including indicator calculations, in a dedicated worker thread. If the worker startup fails, the library automatically falls back to the main-thread implementation.
- **Added Promise-based alternatives for callback widget API methods.** The remaining callback-style methods — `chartReady` (replacing `onChartReady`), `save`, `getSavedCharts`, `saveChartToServer`, `removeChartFromServer`, `showNoticeDialog`, `showConfirmDialog`, `dataReady`, and `setChartType` — can now be called without callbacks and return promises.
  - The callback-based overloads remain available for backward compatibility and emit a one-time deprecation warning per widget/API instance.
  - `widget.setSymbol(symbol, interval, callback)` is deprecated in favour of the existing `widget.activeChart().setSymbol(symbol, options?)` method.
  - The Promise-based `saveChartToServer` rejects with a `SaveChartError` (available as `TradingView.SaveChartError`) — an `Error` subclass that carries the same `SaveChartErrorInfo` object the deprecated `onFail` callback receives, via its `info` property.
  - **Important:** these methods will be removed in a future major release — migrate to the Promise-based API to avoid breakage when that happens.
- **Added the `keep_selected_group_on_tool_creation` featureset.** When enabled, drawings created via [`IChartWidgetApi.createShape`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createshape) and [`IChartWidgetApi.createMultipointShape`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createmultipointshape) are automatically placed into the group of the previously selected drawing or group, provided no explicit `zOrder` is passed in the call options. Toolbar-, hotkey-, and paste-driven drawing creation always uses this behavior regardless of the featureset state.
- **Added the `supportUnpairedExitLevels` flag to allow single-sided exit levels within brackets.** When [`supportMultipleExitLevels`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.BrokerConfigFlags#supportmultipleexitlevels) is enabled, each exit level requires both a take-profit and a stop-loss by default. Now, with [`supportUnpairedExitLevels`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.BrokerConfigFlags#supportunpairedexitlevels) set to `true`, an exit level can contain only one side — either a take-profit or a stop-loss. Note that unpaired levels can only be created in the [Order Ticket](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/order-ticket): chart trading adds paired levels only. See [Multiple exit levels](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/trading-concepts/brackets#multiple-exit-levels) for details. (Trading Platform only)

**Improvements**

- **Renamed legend display labels on the Status line settings tab.** The following labels in the **Settings → Status line** dialog have been updated:
  - **Symbol** → **Instrument**
  - **Description** → **Name**
  - **Ticker** → **Symbol**
  - **Ticker and description** → **Symbol and name**
  - **Long Description** (requires the [`symbol_info_long_description`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#symbol_info_long_description) featureset) → **Description**

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed an issue where timescale marks would not render on slow network connection.**
- **Fixed realtime DWM bar alignment when `disable_resolution_rebuild` is enabled.** Realtime updates from [`subscribeBars`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IDatafeedChartApi#subscribebars) for daily, weekly, and monthly resolutions are now aligned to the expected bar slot when [`disable_resolution_rebuild`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#disable_resolution_rebuild) is enabled. This prevents compare or overlay series from updating the previous candle or leaving a gap when the realtime timestamp falls inside the current  DWM (daily, weekly, monthly) period.
- **Fixed header toolbar crash when the `use_symbol_name_for_header_toolbar` featureset was enabled alongside the `saved_data` widget option.**
- **Fixed Risk/Reward drawings with custom price formatters.** Risk/Reward drawings now use custom `priceFormatterFactory` values in the default formatter path, preventing `NaN` or `Infinity` labels on small-price symbols.
- **Fixed repeated no-data requests on monthly resolutions.** The library now correctly stops requesting older history when a datafeed returns `noData: true` for an empty monthly series.
- **Fixed chart freezing when adding indicators that request daily data, such as Pivot Points Standard.** Session holiday and correction calculations are now cached and use binary
search instead of recomputing on every bar update. Previously, adding an
indicator that requests daily, weekly, or monthly data (for example, Pivot
Points Standard on an intraday chart) on a symbol with many `session_holidays`
or `corrections` entries could saturate the main thread and freeze the chart
on slower machines, especially during realtime updates or when scrolling back
to load more history.
- **Fixed crosshair appearing on mobile after switching timeframes.**
- **Fixed an issue where "Add symbol to watchlist" appeared in the legend menu when the `add_to_watchlist` featureset is disabled.**  (Trading Platform only)
- **Fixed DOM order drag-and-drop sending the wrong price at non-default step sizes.** Dragging an order in the Depth of Market widget now passes the correct price to `modifyOrder` regardless of the selected price-step aggregation. Previously, any step size other than the default scaled the modified price by the step factor. (Trading Platform only)

**Documentation**

- **Updated the Implement Datafeed tutorial to use the Binance REST API.** All code examples now use the Binance REST API instead of CryptoCompare, and the tutorial has been extended with a new [Extend to Trading Platform](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/tutorials/implement_datafeed_tutorial/extend-to-trading-platform) section covering real-time quotes, DOM, news, alerts, and save/load integration.
- **Added a guide for enabling the margin meter in the Order Ticket.** The new section in the [Order Ticket](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/order-ticket#enable-margin-meter) article explains what the margin meter displays and provides step-by-step setup instructions covering the [`supportMargin`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.BrokerConfigFlags#supportmargin) flag, the [`subscribeMarginAvailable`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerTerminal#subscribemarginavailable) and [`unsubscribeMarginAvailable`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerTerminal#unsubscribemarginavailable) broker methods, and the [`marginRate`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.InstrumentInfo#marginrate) property.

## Version 31.2.0

*Date: Tue May 05 2026*

**New Features**

- **Added the `group` property to custom indicator input metainfo.** This property allows you to organize related [inputs](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/custom_studies/metainfo/Custom-Studies-Inputs) under a common header. The `group` value is used as the header's display text in the *Settings* dialog.

**Improvements**

- **Added optional `listId` parameter to `createList` watchlist API method.** The [`createList`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IWatchListApi#createlist) method now accepts an optional `listId` parameter. When provided, if a watchlist with this ID already exists it will be updated instead of creating a duplicate. This allows syncing watchlist IDs with a remote backend to ensure consistency across tabs. (Trading Platform only)
- **Improved account selection behavior in the Account Manager.** The account selection dropdown now automatically closes after an account is selected. (Trading Platform only)
- **Added UI support for multiple exit levels on the chart.** The Take Profit and Stop Loss buttons now reappear on the parent order after the initial brackets are placed. This allows users to add [multiple exit levels](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/trading-concepts/brackets#multiple-exit-levels) directly from the chart. (Trading Platform only)

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed `resetData` breaking timescale display on multichart layout.**

- **Fixed the factor applied to the True Strength Index indicator.** The indicator now correctly returns values within the -100 to +100 range, instead of the previous -1 to +1 range.
- **Fixed cross-tab watchlist pollution when `watchlist_cross_tab_sync` and `use_localstorage_for_settings` are disabled.** Watchlists created in one tab would incorrectly appear in other tabs even when the `watchlist_cross_tab_sync` featureset was disabled. Watchlist creation now skips broadcasting to other tabs when `watchlist_cross_tab_sync` is disabled. (Trading Platform only)
- **Fixed broker custom UI position dialogs receiving incomplete exit level data.** When [`supportMultipleExitLevels`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.BrokerConfigFlags#supportmultipleexitlevels) is enabled, [`customUI.showPositionDialog`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.BrokerCustomUI#showpositiondialog) now receives `brackets.exitLevels` for position and individual position bracket dialogs. (Trading Platform only)
- **Fixed delayed chart refresh when applying trading property overrides.** The chart now updates immediately when applying overrides to `tradingProperties.showOrders` and `tradingProperties.showPositions`, without requiring user interaction. (Trading Platform only)

**Documentation**

- **New datafeed subscriptions guide.** Added an article detailing [datafeed subscriptions lifecycle](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/datafeed-api/datafeed-subscriptions).
It explains what the library treats as a unique dataset, how multiple subscriptions work, and why the library unsubscribes from updates with a delay.

---

## Version 31.1.0

*Date: Wed Apr 08 2026*

**New Features**

- **Added CSP nonce support for widget bootstrap scripts and same-origin iframe loading.** The new [`nonce`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.ChartingLibraryWidgetOptions#nonce) widget constructor property applies a Content Security Policy (CSP) nonce to TradingView-owned bootstrap scripts and runtime-created style/script tags inside the library iframe. When `nonce` is omitted, the library attempts to infer the nonce from `window.__tvCspNonce` or a host-page `<script nonce>`. Script nonce propagation is supported. However, strict nonce-based `style-src` CSP is not currently supported, and library styles still require `style-src 'unsafe-inline'`. This property also works with the [`iframe_loading_same_origin`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#iframe_loading_same_origin) featureset. In this case, the `sameorigin.html` response can provide its own nonce by setting `window.__tvCspNonce`, which takes precedence over the parent-side value.
- **Added globally shared mode for drawings.** This feature allows users to synchronize drawings across all layouts for the same symbol.
The update also adds a "New drawings sync globally" button to the [drawing toolbar](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/drawings#drawing-toolbar).

**Improvements**

- **Extended save/load adapter API for separate drawings storage.** The [`saveLineToolsAndGroups`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IExternalSaveLoadAdapter#savelinetoolsandgroups) method now receives an optional `context` argument containing metadata (`sharingMode`, `symbol`, `requestId`). The [`loadLineToolsAndGroups`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IExternalSaveLoadAdapter#loadlinetoolsandgroups) request context is exposed through [`LineToolsAndGroupsLoadRequestContext`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LineToolsAndGroupsLoadRequestContext). For more information, see [Saving drawings separately](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/saving_loading/saving_drawings_separately).

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed an error in the broker sample implementation when placing a Stop Loss order.**  (Trading Platform only)
- **Fixed an issue where adding orders with exit levels caused a `ReferenceError TradedItemType is not defined`.**  (Trading Platform only)

---

## Version 31.0.0

*Date: Fri Mar 06 2026*

**New Features**

- **Added table view for data visualization.** Users can now view chart and indicator data in a table format.
This mode can be opened via the legend's "More" menu or the chart context menu.
- **Added multiple exit levels (brackets) support.** When the [`supportMultipleExitLevels`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.BrokerConfigFlags#supportmultipleexitlevels) configuration flag is enabled,
users can protect orders and positions with multiple take-profit and stop-loss levels at different prices and quantities.
This feature introduces the `exitLevels` property to order-related interfaces and the `exitLevelId` property to `BracketOrder` for managing these individual levels.
See [Multiple exit levels](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/trading-concepts/brackets#multiple-exit-levels) for more information. (Trading Platform only)
- **Added support for the Crypto Exchange Order Ticket for specific symbols.** Use new [`supportCryptoExchange`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.SymbolSpecificTradingOptions#supportcryptoexchange) property in [`SymbolSpecificTradingOptions`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.SymbolSpecificTradingOptions) to control this behavior.
Note that the crypto-specific ticket is displayed only if the [`supportCryptoExchangeOrderTicket`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.BrokerConfigFlags#supportcryptoexchangeorderticket) flag is enabled and the symbol's [type](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.InstrumentInfo#type) is `crypto`. (Trading Platform only)
- **Added symbol logo support in trading dialogs.** Symbol logos can now be displayed in the *Cancel order* and *Close position* dialogs.
To enable them, use the [`show_symbol_logo_in_cancel_order_dialog`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#show_symbol_logo_in_cancel_order_dialog) and [`show_symbol_logo_in_close_position_dialog`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#show_symbol_logo_in_close_position_dialog) featuresets alongside the global [`show_symbol_logos`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#show_symbol_logos) featureset. (Trading Platform only)

**Improvements**

- **Redesigned empty state styling on the main chart.** Updated the icons and text for all empty states (including invalid symbols and no data) to match the latest design.
The empty state container now has a transparent background and full pane coverage.
This provides improved responsive behavior across multi-chart layouts and the Table view.
- **Added the `supportAdaptiveLayout` broker configuration flag.** When [`supportAdaptiveLayout`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.TradedGroupConfig#supportadaptivelayout) is `true` (default), trading buttons (TP/SL, P&L) on position and order lines will hide on smaller screens and appear on larger ones.
When `false`, these buttons will always be visible, regardless of screen width. (Trading Platform only)
- **Improved trading settings logic.** The *Reverse position button* option is now automatically disabled in the *Trading settings* whenever *Positions and orders* is unchecked. (Trading Platform only)
- **Quantity input types no longer reset when editing orders on the chart.** The Order Ticket now keeps your selected quantity input type (USD, % balance, Risk) even when you adjust order prices or quantities directly on the chart. (Trading Platform only)
- **Improved "No overlap" mode behavior.** The "No overlap" mode setting in the context menu is now persistent, meaning the separation of orders and positions remains active until manually toggled off. (Trading Platform only)

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed a bug where symbols with no trading sessions for an entire week due to holidays could not request data.**
- **Fixed the profit and loss calculation for the risk/reward drawing.** The calculation now correctly uses the actual `qty` based on `lotSize` and multiplies by `pointValue`.
Previously, profit and loss was calculated as if `lotSize = 1`, which produced incorrect values when changing lot size.
- **Fixed quantity rounding for symbols with integer quantities in the Order Ticket.** The quantity calculator now rounds down to `0` if the specified risk or order value is less than the cost of a single unit.
This ensures that validation fails and prevents users from placing an order for `1` unit when the entered value is insufficient to cover the minimum trade value. (Trading Platform only)
- **Fixed an issue where the bracket cancellation dialog would fail to appear.** Previously, when attempting to cancel a bracket order repeatedly, the confirmation dialog might not show up, which prevented the bracket order from actually being cancelled. (Trading Platform only)

**Documentation**

- **New events and subscriptions guide.** Added an article detailing the library's [event system](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/configuration/events-and-subscriptions).
It explains the distinction between widget, chart, and component events.
- **New trading overrides convention guide.** Added a section explaining the [hierarchical naming pattern](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/overrides/trading-overrides#override-properties) for `BrokerOrderOverrides` and `BrokerPositionOverrides`.
It helps identify the specific properties needed to customize the visual state of trading elements.
- **Reorganized the documentation for faster onboarding.** We have streamlined our documentation structure to help you get up and running more quickly.
The [Introduction](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/introduction) and [Get started](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/quick-start) articles are now more focused, and advanced topics have been moved to dedicated functional categories like *Configuration* and *Reference*.
- **Other updates.** The following enhancements were made:
  - Added instructions for [enabling enhanced screen reader descriptions](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/configuration/accessibility#enhanced-descriptions) using the `aria_crosshair_price_description` and `aria_detailed_chart_descriptions` featuresets. They allow screen readers to announce crosshair prices and provide detailed descriptions when the active chart changes.
  - Clarified descriptions for `supportEditAmount`, `supportModifyBrackets`, and `supportModifyOrderPrice` in the [`BrokerConfigFlags`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.BrokerConfigFlags) interface.

## Version 30.3.0

*Date: Wed Jan 21 2026*

**New Features**

- **Added the `legend_bar_change_colors_based_on_value` featureset.** When enabled, bar change values in the legend are dynamically colored. For non-OHLC chart types, the color depends on the value (positive, negative, or zero). For OHLC chart types, the library uses the series' own color scheme.
- **Added the `applyOverrides` method to the `IChartWidgetApi` interface.** Unlike [`IChartingLibraryWidget.applyOverrides`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartingLibraryWidget#applyoverrides), which applies overrides to **all charts**, this new method allows applying overrides to **specific chart instances**.
Refer to [Apply overrides](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Chart#apply-overrides) for usage example.

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed an issue where orders and positions were no longer displayed after a network reconnection.**  (Trading Platform only)

---

## Version 30.2.0

*Date: Mon Dec 22 2025*

**New Features**

- **Added support for paginated Symbol Search results.** Added the optional [`searchSymbolsPaginated`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IDatafeedChartApi#searchsymbolspaginated) method to the Datafeed API. When implemented, the library uses this method instead of [`searchSymbols`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/datafeed-api/required-methods#searchsymbols), loading Symbol Search results in "pages" rather than returning all results at once. For example, the first 50 results can be returned initially, and then more can be loaded on demand as the user scrolls down the list of symbols.
- **Added the `--tv-color-bar-mark-background-color` CSS variable.** This variable allows you to set a custom background color for tooltips shown for [bar marks](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Marks#marks-on-the-chart).
For more information on adjusting UI elements using CSS variables, see [CSS Color Themes](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/styles/CSS-Color-Themes).
- **Supported updating Overlay indicator bars that have a time value less than the two most recent main series times.** Ensured that real-time bars are plotted when an Overlay is "behind" the main series, specifically when the most recent Overlay bar time is less than `mainSeriesBars[mainSeriesBars.length - 2]`.
- **Reenable the Depth of Market (DOM) widget's dynamic mode by default.** The [DOM widget](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/depth-of-market) was made static starting with version 28. This change has been reversed so that the pre-28 dynamic mode is enabled by default. The static mode added in version 28 is still available by enabling the `static_dom` featureset. (Trading Platform only)

**Improvements**

- **VWAP indicator loads the exact amount of data to reach the target anchor.** Instead of showing an error when there isn’t enough data to calculate the VWAP, the indicator now loads the exact amount of data required to reach the target anchor.
- **Added `isAlwaysShownInLegend` property to input definitions in metainfo.** When set, this property keeps any [indicator inputs](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/custom_studies/metainfo/Custom-Studies-Inputs) (`StudySymbolInputInfo`) visible in the legend, even when other indicator inputs are hidden. Note that the [`always_show_study_symbol_input_values_in_legend`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets/#always_show_study_symbol_input_values_in_legend) featureset must be enabled for this property to take effect.

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed an issue where the floating toolbar three dots menu would not call the context menu APIs.**
- **Fixed inaccurate rounding in the Hull indicator calculation.**
- **Fixed an issue where the `onTick` event would not fire.**
- **Fixed an issue where custom indicators that return null values were failing to plot.**
- **Fixed an issue where the `getVisibleBarsRange` method returned the wrong user time.**
- **Fixed an issue where the Overlay indicator was failing to plot because of duplicate bar times.**

**Documentation**

- **New drag-to-export guide.** Check out a guide on how to [enable the drag-to-export feature](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Chart#enable-drag-to-export-feature), including an interactive example.
It explains how users can drag the chart area to export data to external applications, such as pasting JSON into a text editor.
- **New troubleshooting section.** Added a section that explains possible causes and solutions for when [individual positions are not displayed on the chart](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/common-issues#individual-positions-are-not-displayed-on-the-chart).

---

## Version 30.1.0

*Date: Mon Nov 10 2025*

**New Features**

- **Added the `always_show_study_symbol_input_values_in_legend` featureset.** When enabled, this featureset keeps symbol-type [indicator inputs](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/custom_studies/metainfo/Custom-Studies-Inputs) (`StudySymbolInputInfo`) visible in the legend, even when other indicator inputs are hidden. This allows users to visually distinguish multiple instances of the same indicator on the chart by their source symbol.

**Improvements**

- **Improved drag-to-export feature.** When the [`chart_drag_export`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#chart_drag_export) featureset is enabled and [`setDragExportEnabled(true)`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#setdragexportenabled) is called, the chart remains responsive to mouse interactions instead of blocking them. The library now emits [`dragstart`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.SubscribeEventsMap#dragstart) for all drags. To treat a drag as a drag-drop export, set payload via the parameters of the [`setData`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.DragStartParams#setdata) method. The [event parameters](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.DragStartParams) also include current modifier keys (ctrl/meta/alt/shift), enabling patterns like Cmd+Drag without relying on global key listeners.
- **Added the `getVisibleBarsRange` method.** [`getVisibleBarsRange`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#getvisiblebarsrange) returns the range of bar times currently shown on the chart. The method includes existing bars and visible incomplete bars produced by non-time-based chart styles (for example, Renko). Unlike [`getVisibleRange`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#getvisiblerange), `getVisibleBarsRange` doesn't include future bar times beyond the last visible bar.
- **Added a dropdown to change the type of Moving Average used for calculating Bollinger Bands.**

- **Support setting `noData` with non-empty bars response.** It is now possible to signal that there is no more data available, while at the same time returning bars via the [`getBars`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IDatafeedChartApi#getbars) callback. Previously, this would cause a `"noData should be set when there is no data in the requested period and earlier only"` warning to be logged to the console, and a second call would be made to [`getBars`](https:/www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IDatafeedChartApi#getbars).

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed an issue where the widget bar would disappear when resizing.** When transitioning to higher dimensions, the widget bar would not necessarily be properly displayed.
- **Fixed VWAP issue.** The VWAP indicator used to break the chart when applied to a Japanese style chart.
- **Fixed an issue where the main series wouldn’t load more data if an indicator error appeared.**
- **Fixed an issue where the Moving Average Double indicator ignored the `Method` input.**
- **Fixed an issue where an error could be thrown after a pane is removed.**
- **Fixed an issue where creating an anchored shape would fail if placed before the first available bar.**
- **Fixed an issue where the Bollinger Bands indicator could be loaded inconsistently.** The result differed depending on whether it was added from the header dropdown or via the `createStudy` method.
- **Fixed an issue where `showOrderDialog` would use the default implementation instead of the one from `customUI`.**  (Trading Platform only)
- **Fixed an issue where interacting with the DOM could cause errors in the console.**  (Trading Platform only)
- **Fixed an issue where the Order Panel would not be shown on screens less than 493 pixels high.** (Trading Platform only)

**Documentation**

- **Updated navigation and structure.** Restructured and expanded documentation for better navigation and clarity:
  - Created a new [Time and sessions](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/time-and-sessions/) section with an introductory article explaining how to correctly configure bar times, symbol sessions, and resolutions in the datafeed.
  - Reorganized the [Tutorials](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/) section into four dedicated categories: Tutorials, How-to guides, Framework integrations, and Interactive code examples.
- **Added new troubleshooting sections.** Each section explains possible causes and solutions for the corresponding issue.
  - [Incorrect time display in Japanese-style charts](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/Datafeed-Issues#japanese-charts-show-incorrect-time)
  - [Memory leak investigation steps](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/troubleshooting/#memory-leaks)
  - [P&L showing 0 in bracket orders](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/common-issues#pl-in-bracket-orders-shows-0)
- **Other updates.** The following enhancements were made:
  - Added an [interactive example](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Marks#example) showing how to implement marks on the chart or time scale.
  - Expanded explanation and added an example for [enabling custom resolutions](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Resolution#enable-custom-resolutions).
  - Exposed the `addPlusButton` [action ID](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Chart#execute-action-by-id) that enables or disables the *Plus* button on the price scale for [quick trading](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Price-Scale#quick-trading).
  - Clarified the behavior of the [`show_zoom_and_move_buttons_on_touch`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#show_zoom_and_move_buttons_on_touch) featureset on mobile devices.
  - Documented a limitation for `long_positions` and `short_positions` drawing types where the [`text`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.CreateShapeOptions#text) property is auto-generated and must not be set manually.
  - Clarified method descriptions for `mergeUp`, `mergeDown`, `unmergeUp`, and `unmergeDown` in both [`IStudyApi`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IStudyApi/) and [`ISeriesApi`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.ISeriesApi/) interfaces.
  - Updated the [Connecting data](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/) article with clearer descriptions of available integration approaches and their appropriate use cases.

## Version 30.0.0

*Date: Mon Sep 18 2025*

**Breaking Changes**

- **Scrolling and resizing cannot be canceled anymore.** Chart scrolling or resizing via the time or price scale no longer triggers a change event. Therefore, these actions cannot be canceled with undo action anymore.
- **Update line tools overrides.** The text visibility checkbox has been removed from the drawing settings. Now, the text is always displayed when specified.
For this reason, the `showLabel` override property has no effect for the line tools such as trendline.
- **Update UDF properties.** Both `exchange-listed` and `exchange-traded` have been marked deprecated in favour of a single `exchange_listed_name` property.
From version 31 they will be removed.
- **Extend featureset to display inactivity gaps on DWM charts.** The new [`inactivity_gaps`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#inactivity_gaps) featureset replaces the existing `intraday_inactivity_gaps` and enables the display of inactivity gaps both on intraday and DWM (daily, weekly, monthly) charts. For more information, refer to the [Show/hide gaps on the chart](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Chart#showhide-gaps-on-the-chart) section.
- **Removed support for iOS version below 15.** Only iOS versions including and above 16 are now compatible with the library.
- **Default value of `supportOrdersHistory` changed to `true`.** This means the *History* page in the [Account Manager](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/account-manager/) is enabled by default and requires the [`ordersHistory`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerTerminal#ordershistory) method to be implemented. If you don't plan to support order history, set [`supportOrdersHistory`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.BrokerConfigFlags#supportordershistory) to `false` in your broker configuration. This hides the *History* page and prevents related errors. (Trading Platform only)

**New Features**

- **Added the "Day of week labels" checkbox to the "Scales and lines" settings dialog.**
- **Added a floating tooltip for detailed bar analysis in the *Cursors* menu.** On a long press on the chart, the tooltip appears and displays the OHLCV values and price change for the selected bar.
It then follows the cursor or finger as you move, providing a seamless way to inspect data across the chart.
To disable this feature, use the `long_press_floating_tooltip` featureset.
- **Added "No overlap mode" toggle for orders and positions.** A new option is now available in the context menu of orders and positions on the chart. When enabled, it prevents trading lines and labels at the same price level from stacking, automatically offsetting them vertically for better readability.

**Improvements**

- **Added option to remove locked drawings.** A new toggle *Always remove locked drawings* is now available in the left toolbar’s delete menu.
When enabled, this option forces the deletion of locked drawings along with other items.
- **Added subscription for *Zoom out* tool.** [`IChartWidgetApi`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi) has a new property `canZoomOutWV`. It returns whether the chart can be zoomed out using [`zoomOut`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#zoomout).
- **The `onSymbolChanged` method returns the right type.** [`onSymbolChanged`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#onsymbolchanged) now returns the expected type.
- **Deprecated support for letters in shortcuts.** The support for letters in [shortcuts](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/configuration/Shortcuts) has been deprecated. Starting from version 31, string key names are no longer supported.
Old styles like `'ctrl+shift+/'` or `['ctrl', 'shift', '/']` are deprecated. Use the supportable style like `['ctrl', 'shift', 191]` instead. For more information, refer to the [Manage shortcuts](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/configuration/Shortcuts#manage-shortcuts) section.
- **Added a `label` property to StudyOrDrawingAddedToChartEventParams.** The [`label`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.StudyOrDrawingAddedToChartEventParams#label) property contains the indicator's name as defined in the [`description`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.RawStudyMetaInfo#description) field of its [metainfo](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/custom_studies/metainfo).
- **New featuresets for legend in-place edit.** The `disable_legend_inplace_resolution_change` and `disable_legend_inplace_symbol_change` featuresets control whether users can change the resolution or symbol directly from the [legend](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Legend).
- **Show symbol name in the _Сompare_ dialog.** When the [`use_symbol_name_for_header_toolbar`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#use_symbol_name_for_header_toolbar) featureset is enabled, the symbol [`name`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/Symbology/#name) is displayed in the _Compare_ search dialog instead of [`ticker`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/Symbology/#ticker).
- **Added new time zone for Kabul.**

- **Added new APIs to control the watermark settings.** The [Watermark API](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/watermarks#watermark-api-recommended) now has three different properties that can be set independently:
  - [`tickerVisibility`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IWatermarkApi/#tickervisibility) to toggle the display of the ticker (e.g. AAPL)
  - [`intervalVisibility`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IWatermarkApi/#intervalvisibility) to toggle the display of the interval (e.g. 1h)
  - [`descriptionVisibility`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IWatermarkApi/#descriptionvisibility) to toggle the display of the description (e.g. Apple Inc.)
- **The `setVisibleRange` method can be rejected.** [`setVisibleRange`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#setvisiblerange) now returns a `Promise` that can be rejected.
- **Added `chart_theme_changed` event to `SubscribeEventsMap`.** The [`chart_theme_changed`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.SubscribeEventsMap#chart_theme_changed) event is fired when a user applies a saved [chart template](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/saving_loading#chart-templates), resets the theme to the default built-in settings, or when the [`changeTheme`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartingLibraryWidget#changetheme) or [`loadChartTemplate`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#loadcharttemplate) methods are called.
- **New `applyTradingCustomization` method.** This method allows you to override the style of order and position lines created with the [Broker API](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/trading-concepts#broker-api) after the widget has been created. (Trading Platform only)
- **Added a date property to `PositionBase`.** [`PositionBase`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.PositionBase) now has an optional `updateTime` property. (Trading Platform only)
- **Added a `canBeClosed` property to different Position APIs.** Both [`IndividualPositionBase`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IndividualPositionBase) and [`IndividualPosition`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IndividualPosition) now have an optional `canBeClosed` property to determine if a position can be closed. (Trading Platform only)
- **Added price information (price and profit/loss details) to the tooltip for positions, orders, and brackets.**  (Trading Platform only)
- **Redesigned *Trading settings* panel.** The *Trading settings* panel has been reworked to be more intuitive and provide users with clearer options for customizing their trading view. (Trading Platform only)

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed an issue where Spread and Ratio indicators did not work correctly on intraday resolutions.** Previously, the Spread and Ratio indicators did not work correctly on intraday resolutions when the compared symbol had a different session (e.g., 24x7 and 0930-1630).
- **Fixed an issue where the _Long Position_ and _Short Position_ drawings were not reversed correctly.**

- **Fixed a bug that allowed orders to be placed without a price.**  (Trading Platform only)
- **Fixed *Reverse* button color overrides.** Previously, setting override properties for the *Reverse* button within the [`trading_customization`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.TradingTerminalWidgetOptions#trading_customization) object would result in the button rendering as black. (Trading Platform only)

**Documentation**

- **AI docs assistant.** You can now download a comprehensive knowledge file containing our complete, up-to-date documentation and full TypeScript definitions. Feed this file to your favorite LLM to create a dedicated expert assistant for our library, ensuring you get accurate, context-aware answers and code examples. [Learn how to set it up](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/resources/llm-context).
- **New watermarks guide.** The [Watermarks](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/watermarks) article explains how to programmatically control the watermark's visibility, color, and content using the Watermark API.
- **New profit and loss article.** The [Profit and loss](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/trading-concepts/profit-and-loss) article explains how to provide P&L values from your backend. It details the different methods for updating the data and clarifies how the library uses this data for the *Money*, *Ticks*, and *Percentage* display modes.
- **Other updates.** The following enhancements were made:
  - Added a new section that describes [time ranges](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Time-Scale#time-range) and how to use `setVisibleRange`.
  - Added a new section that describes [how to show/hide gaps on the chart](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Chart#showhide-gaps-on-the-chart) using the `intraday_inactivity_gaps` featureset.
  - Updated information on [mobile app development](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/mobile_specifics#mobile-applications).
  - Updated [`setMinimumAdditionalDepth`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IContext#setminimumadditionaldepth) description, mentioning when to use the method.
  - Updated the [Trading primitives](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/Trading-Primitives) article, providing clear explanations and examples on the primitive methods.
  - Updated the [Online playgrounds](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/Online-Editors) article, providing templates for [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tradingview).
- **Update the Datafeed API tutorial.** We updated both the code example and documentation for the [How to connect data via datafeed API](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/implement_datafeed_tutorial) tutorial. The latest version introduces several key improvements:

  - Added support for minute and hour resolutions.
  - Removed `full_name` from the `SymbolInfo` object. Now, `ticker` is used instead.
  - `searchSymbols` now properly filters results by user input, selected exchange, and symbol type.
  - `getBars` now selects the correct API endpoint based on the requested `resolution` (minute, hour, or day), ensuring the most appropriate data is used.
  - Reworked streaming logic to support multiple subscriptions to data updates.

## Version 29.6.0

*Date: Wed Aug 13 2025*

**Improvements**

- **Added a `label` property to `StudyOrDrawingAddedToChartEventParams`.** The [`label`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.StudyOrDrawingAddedToChartEventParams/#label) property contains the indicator's name as defined in the [`description`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.RawStudyMetaInfo/#description) field of its [metainfo](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/custom_studies/metainfo/).

---

## Version 29.5.0

*Date: Tue Aug 05 2025*

**Improvements**

- **Improved crosshair movement in tracking mode on mobile.** Previously, the crosshair moved incorrectly in tracking mode when `vert_touch_drag_scroll` was disabled. Now, page scrolling is disabled in tracking mode, allowing the crosshair to move on touch.
- **Added `setLayoutSizes` method to `IChartingLibraryWidget`.** The [`setLayoutSizes`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartingLibraryWidget#setlayoutsizes) method can be used to resize the charts in [multiple-chart layouts](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal#multiple-chart-layout). (Trading Platform only)

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed an issue where setMinimumAdditionalDepth would be ignored.** Fixed an issue where custom studies would sometimes not request enough historic bars after calling [`setMinimumAdditionalDepth`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IContext/#setminimumadditionaldepth).
- **Fixed an issue where pivot points could be drawn on the wrong bar for overnight sessions.** Fixed an issue where pivot points could be drawn on the wrong bars for symbols with overnight sessions when calculating with a daily timeframe.

---

## Version 29.4.0

*Date: Tue Jun 25 2025*

**New Features**

- **Added new legend property.** A new overrides property `paneProperties.legendProperties.showSeriesLegendCloseOnMobile` was added to hide/show the close value in the legend when on mobile. The default value is `true`.
- **Support multiple tick resolution.** The library now supports multiple [tick resolutions](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/time-and-sessions/configure-datafeed-resolutions#resolution-in-ticks). Previously, it was possible to set only `1T` resolution.<br/>
Note that the library does not support tick multipliers. This means it is not possible to build a higher resolution (e.g., `10T`) from a lower one (e.g., `1T`). Therefore, your datafeed must explicitly provide each required resolution. (Trading Platform only)
- **Enabled custom price formatting for Watchlist values.** `priceFormatterFactory` from [`custom_formatters`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.ChartingLibraryWidgetOptions#custom_formatters) can now be used to format values displayed in the Watchlist columns titled _Last_ and _Chg_. (Trading Platform only)

**Improvements**

- **Updated snapshots functionality in the top toolbar.** Now, handling and storing [snapshots](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Snapshots) rely solely on the [`snapshot_url`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.ChartingLibraryWidgetOptions#snapshot_url) property.
This means all server-side snapshot actions (*Copy link*, *Open in new tab*, *Tweet image*) must be implemented using your own server.
For details on how to set up your own server, see our guide to [implementing a snapshot server](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/how-to-guides/implement-snapshots-server).
- **Added the `use_symbol_name_for_header_toolbar` featureset.** This featureset allows you to show the symbol name over the ticker in the _Symbol Search_ dialog.
- **Added `searchSource` parameter to `searchSymbols`.** [`searchSymbols`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IDatafeedChartApi#searchsymbols) now receives a new parameter `searchSource` to indicate where the search was triggered from.
- **Added a new property to the `BrokerCustomUI` interface.** [`showReversePositionDialog`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.BrokerCustomUI#showreversepositiondialog) allows overriding the default *Reverse position* dialog with a custom implementation.
- **Added VWAP insufficient data warning.** Users will now see a warning icon and message in the legend if there isn't enough data loaded to calculate VWAP.
- **Add featureset to display inactivity gaps on intraday charts.** The new `intraday_inactivity_gaps` featureset enables the display of inactivity gaps on intraday charts. These gaps represent periods within the trading session when there has been no trading activity, resulting in missing bars on the chart.<br/>
When `intraday_inactivity_gaps` is enabled, a checkbox appears in the chart settings dialog, allowing users to toggle inactivity gaps on or off. The featureset also exposes the `intradayInactivityGaps` watched value on the Widget API for programmatic control.
- **Improved data loading efficiency by throttling data requests during user scrolling.** This significantly reduces the frequency of small, incremental requests to the Datafeed API.
- **Order & Position lines display the same information on desktop and mobile.** Users can now benefit from the same design on both desktop and mobile when an order/position is displayed on the chart. (Trading Platform only)

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed indicator template favorite menu bug.** Fixed an issue where favoriting an indicator template with leading whitespace in its name caused the quick access button in the header menu to appear empty.
- **Fixed Relative Strength Index indicator.** The Relative Strength Index indicator was broken in version 29.2.0 and has now been fixed.
- **Fixed a bug where switching chart type to a Japanese one would lead to an error in the console.**

- **Fixed vertical line drawing bug.** Fixed an issue where it was impossible to move an existing vertical line drawing to the right of the most recent bar on the chart.

- **Fixed the spread operator issue in the Compare symbol dialog.** Spread operators now function correctly in the _Compare symbol_ dialog, ensuring consistency with the _Symbol Search_ dialog.
- **Fix for sameorigin.html loading from relative path.** This fix ensures proper loading of the `sameorigin.html` file when using the `iframe_loading_same_origin` featureset and the current page is not the root page.
- **The `_getStyleOverrides` error message.** Fixed a bug where the `_getStyleOverrides` error message could be seen in the console when instantiating the chart with pre-existing orders or positions. (Trading Platform only)
- **Fix rendering of multiple execution shapes on a single bar.** Fixed an issue where adding multiple [execution shapes](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/drawings/drawings-api#createexecutionshape) to a single bar would only render the first shape. (Trading Platform only)

## Version 29.3.0

*Date: Thu May 08 2025*

**New Features**

- **Added HLC bars chart style.** The HLC bars chart style is the same as regular bars but doesn't display the open price. When exporting a series or [overlay](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/indicators#add-and-compare-new-series) indicator that uses the HLC bars chart style, open values are not included. Open values also do not appear in the data window or [legend](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Legend) for series or overlay indicators using this style.

**Improvements**

- **Added price scale details to context menu event.** When invoking the [context menu](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/context-menu) on the price scale, it now returns the following details:
  - `id` of the price scale
  - `paneIndex` which is the index of the pane the price scale is linked to
  - `chartIndex`  which is the index of the chart the price scale is linked to
- **Added icon to dropdown items.** A new property `icon` was added to the [`DropdownItem`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.DropdownItem) interface.

**Bug Fixes**

- **Empty context menu.** Fixed an issue where the [context menu](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/context-menu) would be partially empty on mobile
- **onContextMenu callback received incorrect arguments.** Fixed a bug where the [`onContextMenu`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartingLibraryWidget#oncontextmenu) callback received an object instead of the expected arguments.
- **Autosave won't trigger with empty text box created during autosave delay.**
- **Fixed an error where vertical lines would revert to their previous position when moved beyond latest bar.** Fixes [#8894](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8894)

**Documentation**

- **The following enhancements were made.**
  - Added a new section explaining how to [programmatically open and close Symbol Search](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Symbol-Search#openclose-symbol-search).
  - Updated the [Customization overview](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization) and [Time zones](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/timezones) articles.

## Version 29.2.0

*Date: Tue Apr 08 2025*

**New Features**

- **Added new methods to Trading Host.** The [Trading Host](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/trading-concepts#trading-host) now includes three new methods designed to clear specific caches and trigger fresh data fetches:
  - [`ordersFullUpdate`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost#ordersfullupdate)
  - [`positionsFullUpdate`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost#positionsfullupdate)
  - [`individualPositionsFullUpdate`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost#individualpositionsfullupdate)
- **Added cross-tab synchronization for watchlists.** This feature is enabled by default and requires the `use_localstorage_for_settings` [featureset](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets) to be enabled.
To disable the cross-tab synchronization, use the `watchlist_cross_tab_sync` featureset. (Trading Platform only)

**Improvements**

- **New `resetCache` method.** The new `resetCache` method allows you to delete previously loaded data for all symbol and resolution combinations known to the datafeed at once. You can use this method instead of [`onResetCacheNeededCallback`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IDatafeedChartApi#subscribebars) to clear the cache before calling [`resetData`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#resetdata). In this case, you do not need to wait for [`subscribeBars`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IDatafeedChartApi#subscribebars) to be called to access the callback.

**Bug Fixes**

- **Save button tooltip still shows shortcut when `save_shortcut` is disabled.** Fixed a bug where the _Save_ button's tooltip still showed the shortcut when the `save_shortcut` featureset was disabled. Fixes [#8925](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8925)
- **Compare Symbol search dialog behavior.** Fixed an issue where the library would try to resolve a symbol that may not exist when users pressed _Enter_ whenever the featureset `allow_arbitrary_symbol_search_input` would be enabled.
- **Adding a custom interval could cause an error.** Adding a custom interval after enabling the [`custom_resolution`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#custom_resolutions) featureset used to cause a console error.
- **Fixed an issue where on some occasions PineJS functions would not return the right values when internally comparing it to MIN_VALUE or MAX_VALUE.**

- **Future bar time extrapolation with `disable_resolution_rebuild`.** Fixed an issue where future bar times would be extrapolated incorrectly when the `disable_resolution_rebuild` featureset was enabled, and daily bars that do not consider the January 1 to be the first day of the year were provided to the library.
- **Compare symbol legend context menu.** Fixed an issue where the context menu for compared symbols would show the _Add this indicator to favorites_ item.
- **Main series context menu.** Fixed an issue where the [context menu](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/context-menu) for the main series would show a blank space instead of the _Add SYMBOL to watchlist_ item.
- **Watchlist item counter.** Fixed an issue where the watchlist item count would include section titles in its calculation.
- **Fixed an issue with time scale marks that couldn't contain any underscore character.**

- **Fixed a bug where `getBars` failed to display error messages containing semicolons.**

- **Fixed drawing keyboard shortcuts.** Fixed an issue where using keyboard shortcuts to add drawings would sometimes open the _Symbol Search_ dialog instead of adding the intended drawing.

**Documentation**

- **The following enhancements were made.**
  - Added a new section explaining how to [display pre- and post-market price lines](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/time-and-sessions/Extended-Sessions#enable-the-price-line).
  - Added a new section explaining how to [provide profit and loss values](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/trading-concepts/profit-and-loss) in Trading Platform.
  - Updated the [Trading Session](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/time-and-sessions/Trading-Sessions) article with information on how to specify [session history](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/time-and-sessions/Trading-Sessions#session-history)

---

## Version 29.1.0

*Date: Fri Mar 07 2025*

### New Features

- **Added the _Another symbol_ input field to Moving Average Multiple, Moving Average Triple, and Pivot Points Standard.** This field allows users to specify a different symbol for calculating the indicator. By default, the current symbol on the chart is used.<ReleaseNoteAnchor id="v29_1-added_other_symbol_to_moving_average_multiple_and_triple" /><br/>

#### Trading Platform only

- **Pre-/post-market lines.** Added the `pre_post_market_price_line` featureset that allows you to enable or disable the pre-/post-market price lines. To display the pre-/post-market lines, you need to provide the `rtc` property in [quotes](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Datafeed.DatafeedQuoteValues).<ReleaseNoteAnchor id="v29_1-pre_post_market_lines" /><br/>

### Improvements

- **Adds an offset input to the Bollinger Bands indicator.**
- **Allow overriding the default shortcuts.** Now, you can override the default shortcuts using the [`onShortcut`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartingLibraryWidget#onshortcut) method. Note that modal dialogs shortcuts cannot be changed.

### Documentation

- **New articles.** Explore our latest articles:

- **Other updates.** The following enhancements were made:
  - Updated the guide on [how to add a custom page to the Account Manager](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/how-to-guides/create-custom-page-in-account-manager). It now describes how to make the symbol name clickable on the custom page.
  - Added a guide on how to troubleshoot when [quotes are not displayed or refreshed](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/Datafeed-Issues#quotes-are-not-displayed-or-refreshed).
  - Added a guide on how to troubleshoot [delays in Trading Platform UI elements](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/Datafeed-Issues#delays-in-trading-platform-ui-elements).
  - Added a new FAQ — [Does the library set cookies](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/resources/Frequently-Asked-Questions#other-questions).

---

## Version 29.0.0

*Date: Wed Feb 05 2025*

**Breaking Changes**

- **Removed trading API methods from Advanced Charts.** The following methods are now available exclusively in Trading Platform. If you’re using Advanced Charts, these methods will no longer be accessible.
  - [`createOrderLine`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createorderline)
  - [`createPositionLine`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createpositionline)
  - [`createExecutionShape`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createexecutionshape)
- **Changed the `getPositionDialogOptions` signature.** The [`getPositionDialogOptions`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerCommon#getpositiondialogoptions) method is asynchronous and returns a promise now. The method also expects a symbol as a parameter.
- **Broker API simplification.** To further improve and simplify the library, we have merged the two existing APIs, `IBrokerWithoutRealtime` and `IBrokerTerminal`, and now exclusively expose the latter. Additionally, we have removed the `subscribeDOM`/`unsubscribeDOM` methods, as they were rarely used and duplicated the functionality of [`subscribeDepth`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/datafeed-api/trading-platform-methods#subscribedepth)/[`unsubscribeDepth`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/datafeed-api/trading-platform-methods#unsubscribedepth). This change ensures that the datafeed fully handles all data management responsibilities.
- **Removed the anchored note drawing.**
- **Renamed the note drawing to pin.**
- **Updated the default colors for drawings/indicators with Volume Profiles.**
- **Added MACD smoothing inputs.**
- **Drawing creation methods now return Promises instead of synchronous values.** The drawing creation methods ([`createShape`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createshape), [`createMultipointShape`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createmultipointshape), and [`createAnchoredShape`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createanchoredshape)) now return Promises that resolve to the drawing ID. The methods also throw an Error through a rejected Promise when the drawing creation fails, instead of returning `null`.
- **Trading Platform methods for drawing creation now return Promises instead of synchronous values.** The ([`createOrderLine`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createorderline), [`createPositionLine`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createpositionline), and [`createExecutionShape`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createexecutionshape)) methods now return Promises that resolve to the corresponding API interface.  (Trading Platform only)

**New Features**

- **Added the _Another symbol_ input field to Ichimoku Cloud, Bollinger Bands, and Average Price.** This field allows users to specify a different symbol for calculating the indicator. By default, the current symbol on the chart is used.
- **New properties for customizing order and position lines.** You can now override the style of order and position lines created with the [Broker API](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/trading-concepts#broker-api).
The [`trading_customization`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.TradingTerminalWidgetOptions#trading_customization) option in the Widget Constructor now supports `brokerOrder` and `brokerPosition` properties.
For more details, see the [Trading Overrides](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/overrides/trading-overrides#created-with-broker-api) article. (Trading Platform only)

**Improvements**

- **Added an option to keep the leftmost bar visible after resolution switching.** By default, the library resets the chart to the latest data when the resolution is changed. To keep the current time range, users can enable the Save chart left edge position when changing interval option in *Chart settings* → *Scales*.
- **Added option to hide/show scroll to the most recent bar button.** The presence of the *Scroll to the most* recent bar button now depends on the Navigation buttons settings (*Chart settings* → *Canvas* → *Buttons* → *Navigation*).
- **Added a new `paneIndex` getter to the `StudyAPI`.** The [`paneIndex`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IStudyApi#paneindex) function returns the index of the pane the indicator belongs to.
- **Enabled users to adjust coordinates of parallel channel within the drawing settings.**
- **Enabled users to reverse the long/short position drawings.**
- **Buy/Sell buttons' visibility can now be changed for each chart in the layout.**
- **Added the Volume option for the date range and date & price range tools.**
- **Added multiline option for parallel channel.** Additional level lines have been added.
- **Show price line of Heikin Ashi on real price when the real price label is selected.** On Heikin Ashi chart, the price line now matches the position of the *Last price* label when the *Real prices on price scale (instead of Heikin-Ashi price)* setting is enabled.
- **Added new time zone Azores (UTC-1).**
- **Added an error message for unsupported resolutions.** If the selected resolution is not supported by the current symbol, an error message appears on the chart along with a button to switch to a supported resolution.
- **Implemented dynamic loading for drawings to optimize bundle size.** Drawings have been refactored to utilize dynamic imports, reducing the initial bundle size by loading these components on-demand. This optimization results in faster initial page loads and improved application startup time, while maintaining full drawing functionality through lazy loading when tools are actually accessed by users.
- **Added a star icon to chart context menu for indicator.** This icon is displayed next to the _Add this indicator to favorites / Remove this indicator_ from favorites option in the indicator context menu.
- **Changed the return type for `OrderPreviewResult`.** When implementing [`previewOrder`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerTerminal#previeworder), you can specify links to external URLs now. The links will be displayed within the `warnings` or `errors` block.   (Trading Platform only)

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed unreliable onChartReady callback with cached bundles.** When using `iframe_loading_compatibility_mode` with cached library bundles, the `onChartReady` callback would sometimes fail to execute. Fixes [#8889](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8889)
- **Long/short position tools are extended to the right if the next bar crosses stop/profit level.** Fixed a bug where long/short position would get partially extended to the right if the next bar crossed the stop/profit level.
- **Fixed hovering on the indicator legend.** Now, when an indicator is deleted via the legend, the hover state shifts to the legend of the next indicator below.
- **Fixed an issue when cloning drawings that were not selected.** Fixed a bug where _Ctrl+Drag_ would create copies of the last selected drawings on chart, even if they were no longer selected. Now, this shortcut enables area selection.

**Documentation**

- **New how-to guide.** Check out a new [guide](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/how-to-guides/add-custom-button-to-top-toolbar) on how to add a custom button to the top toolbar.
- **Other updates.** The following enhancements were made:
  - Added a new section that explains [multiple symbol resolving](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/datafeed-api/required-methods#multiple-symbol-resolving).
  - Updated the [Toolbars](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Toolbars) article.
  - Added a new [section](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Chart#execute-action-by-id) that describes how to trigger specific actions, such as opening the *Chart settings* dialog, using the [`executeActionById`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#executeactionbyid) method.
  - Added an [overview](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/product-comparison) of other TradingView products.

---

## Version 28.5.0

*Date: Wed Dec 18 2024*

**New Features**

- **Added `baselinePosition` property for column series.** The [`baselinePosition`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.ColumnStylePreferences#baselineposition) property allows column series to be drawn relative to the specified baseline value.
  - The default value is `'bottom'`, which draws columns with the bottom of the chart pane as their baseline.
  - Setting the value to `'zero'` draws columns with a baseline of 0, displayed as either 0% or 0.00 depending on the price scale mode.
- **Added the _Another symbol_ input field to Moving Average Double.** This field allows users to specify a different symbol for calculating the indicator. By default, the current symbol on the chart is used.

**Documentation**

- **New how-to guide.** Check out a new [guide](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/how-to-guides/create-custom-page-in-account-manager) that explains how to create a custom page in the Account Manager.
- **Other updates.** The following enhancements were made:
  - Added a new section that explains how to enable and specify [last day change values](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Legend#last-day-change-values).
  - Updated information on [overnight sessions](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/time-and-sessions/Trading-Sessions#overnight-sessions).
  - Updated information on how to [close](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/trading-concepts/positions#close-positions) and [reverse](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/trading-concepts/positions#reverse-positions) positions.
  - Updated API overview page.

## Version 28.4.0

*Date: Thu Nov 28 2024*

**New Features**

- **Added `includeOHLCValuesForSingleValuePlots` option when exporting data.** When set to `true`, this option forces all four OHLC plot values to be exported, even if the plot has a single value. This applies, for example, when the symbol has `visible_plots_set: 'c'` or when the exported plot is a single-value style (Area, Baseline, Line, Line with markets, Stepline, or Column).

**Improvements**

- **Added logging of quotes events.** Added extra logging of quote events when [debug mode](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/enable-debug-mode#enable-debug-mode-for-data-connection) is enabled. The logs will contain information about quote data requests, real-time subscribe and unsubscribe events, and alerts for data requests that do not respond within 10 seconds.

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed an issue where missing translations caused errors when opening the settings dialog of the Ichimoku Cloud indicator.**
- **Fixed an issue where the Point and Figure series would not be displayed.**

**Documentation**

- **New articles.** Explore our latest articles:
  - [Positions](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/trading-concepts/positions) — an article that overviews position types supported in the library and describes how to manage them.
  - [UI elements](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements) — an overview of the library's UI elements.
  - [News](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/news) — an article that explains how to connect data to the _News_ widget.

  - [Market Status](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/market-status)

## Version 28.3.0

*Date: Thu Oct 24 2024*

**New Features**

- **Symbol name in the Watchlist and Details widgets.** Now, the [`DatafeedQuoteValues.short_name`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Datafeed.DatafeedQuoteValues#short_name) value is displayed as a symbol's short name in the [Watchlist](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/Watch-List) and [Details](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal#details).
 You can disable the [`prefer_quote_short_name`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#prefer_quote_short_name) featureset to revert to the old behavior. In this case, the [`ticker`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LibrarySymbolInfo#ticker) value will be used instead. `Trading Platform Only`

**Bug Fixes**

- **Anchored note in multi-layout.** Fixed an issue where plotting a saved anchored note in multi-layout would raise an error. `Trading Platform Only`
- **Fixed symbol logo persistence in legend.** Resolved an issue where a failed image load (e.g., a 404 error) for a symbol logo would cause the previous logo to persist in the legend. Now, the legend correctly updates to reflect the absence of a logo when loading fails. See the [Symbol logos](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Legend#symbol-logos) section of the Legend documentation for more details on the feature.
- **Fixed ordering of symbol logos.** Fixed an issue where symbol logos with two URLs defined in [`logo_urls`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LibrarySymbolInfo#logo_urls) were displayed in an inconsistent order. The order has been corrected on the chart legend and within the Account Manager table.

## Version 28.2.0

*Date: Tue Oct 01 2024*

**New Features**

- **Added `Rank Correlation Index` indicator.**
- **Support building seconds bars from ticks.** Trading Platform now supports building seconds bars from ticks for symbols configured to support it. Compatible symbols must set the [`build_seconds_from_ticks`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LibrarySymbolInfo#build_seconds_from_ticks) flag to `true`. Additionally, [`has_seconds`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LibrarySymbolInfo#has_seconds) and [`has_ticks`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LibrarySymbolInfo#has_ticks) must be `true`, and [`seconds_multipliers`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LibrarySymbolInfo#seconds_multipliers) must be an empty array or only contain multipliers that the datafeed provides itself. `Trading Platform Only`
- **Sped up sorting animation in the Account Manager.** Raised by [#8760](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8760) `Trading Platform Only`

**Improvements**

- **Added an option to customize the default Volume MA calculation in the Volume indicator.** By default, the Volume MA, optionally plotted in the Volume indicator, used the SMA calculation. We have now introduced two additional options: EMA and WMA.
- **Added new event to `SubscribeEventsMap`.** The [`timeframe_interval`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.SubscribeEventsMap#timeframe_interval) event is triggered when the one of the bottom left intervals is selected or the [`setTimeFrame`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#settimeframe) API is used.
- **Added a symbol change to MACD indicator.** It is now possible to change the targeted symbol when plotting MACD indicator without using the main series.

## Version 28.1.0

*Date: Wed Sep 04 2024*

**Breaking Changes**

- **Deprecated API methods.** [`activateBottomWidget`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost#activatebottomwidget) is now marked `deprecated`. Please use [`setAccountManagerVisibilityMode`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost#setaccountmanagervisibilitymode) instead.
If you want to retrieve the current state of the Account Manager please use [`getAccountManagerVisibilityMode`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost#getaccountmanagervisibilitymode)

**New Features**

- **Added `iframe_loading_same_origin` featureset.** The `iframe_loading_same_origin` featureset ensures the library's iframe is loaded from the same domain as the `library_path` files.

**Improvements**

- **Added new event to `SubscribeEventsMap`.** The [`study_dialog_save_defaults`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.SubscribeEventsMap#study_dialog_save_defaults) event is triggered when the _Save as default_ option is selected in the indicator settings.
- **Changed the return type for `OrderPreviewResult`.** When implementing [`previewOrder`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerTerminal#previeworder), you can specify links to external URLs now. The links will be displayed within the `warnings` or `errors` block.  `Trading Platform Only`
- **Added an item counter for custom pages.** By default, custom pages added to the [Account Manager](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/account-manager) do not display the number of items in their corresponding table. Enabling [`displayCounterInTab`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.AccountManagerPage#displaycounterintab) will show this number next to the tab title.  `Trading Platform Only`

**Bug Fixes**

- **charting_library_debug_mode.** Fixed an issue where enabling the featureset `charting_library_debug_mode` was of no effect.

- **Instant display of refreshed marks.** Fixed an issue where new [marks](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Marks) added after calling [`refreshMarks`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#refreshmarks) were not immediately displayed on the chart. Previously, these marks only appeared after user interaction, but now they are instantly visible once the data is provided.
- **Fixed an issue with `multiple_watchlists` featureset.** When the `multiple_watchlists` featureset was disabled, it was still possible to see the `Create a new list` option under the Watchlist drop-down menu.

**Documentation**

- **New how-to guide.** Check out a new guide on [enabling debug modes](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/enable-debug-mode) to help identify potential issues when implementing your app and ensure it is running smoothly.

## Version 28.0.0

*Date: Wed Aug 14 2024*

**Breaking Changes**

- **Removed `full_name`.** The `LibrarySymbolInfo.full_name` property was removed from public API. The property contained strings in the `'EXCHANGE:SYMBOL'` format and was used to request data from the datafeed. Therefore:
  - Now, you should use either the [`name`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LibrarySymbolInfo#name) or [`ticker`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LibrarySymbolInfo#ticker) property to specify an identifier for a certain symbol. For more information, refer to the [Symbology](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/Symbology#symbol-name) article.
  - Instead of `'EXCHANGE:SYMBOL'`, the library will send either `name` or `ticker` values to the datafeed when calling methods such as [`getBars`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IDatafeedChartApi#getbars), [`getQuotes`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IDatafeedQuotesApi#getquotes), and [`subscribeQuotes`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IDatafeedQuotesApi#subscribequotes).
  - The `'EXCHANGE:SYMBOL'` strings are no longer displayed in the Trading Platform UI. The symbol name will be used instead. You can disable the [`prefer_symbol_name_over_fullname`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#prefer_symbol_name_over_fullname) featureset to revert to the old behavior. `Trading Platform Only`
- **Deprecated API methods.** The following methods are now marked `deprecated` for the Advanced Charts users.
  - [`createOrderLine`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createorderline)
  - [`createPositionLine`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createpositionline)
  - [`createExecutionShape`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createexecutionshape)

  These methods will be removed from the Advanced Charts library in the next major version.
  However, they will still be available in Trading Platform.
- **Make `cancelOrders` optional.** The [`cancelOrders`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerWithoutRealtime#cancelorders) method is marked as optional because the library calls it only for the [Depth of Market](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal#depth-of-market) widget. `Trading Platform Only`
- **Removed the `calculatePLUsingLast` flag.** The `calculatePLUsingLast` [broker configuration flag](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/trading-concepts/trading-features-configuration) has been removed. `Trading Platform Only`
- **Symbol search dialog behavior.** Previously, when users pressed _Enter_ in the [_Symbol Search_](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Symbol-Search) dialog, they could enter arbitrary input directly. This input was passed to the datafeed for resolution and loading, regardless of whether the input matched any search results.<br />
Now, pressing _Enter_ selects the top search result unless the user has explicitly chosen another item. If there are no search results, pressing _Enter_ will have no effect. You can enable the [`allow_arbitrary_symbol_search_input`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/Featuresets#allow_arbitrary_symbol_search_input) featureset to use the old behavior.
- **Change custom translation API.** Change the [custom_translate_function](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.ChartingLibraryWidgetOptions#custom_translate_function) interface to accept different parameters: the original text, the singular original text, and the translated text. For example "prices", "price", "prix".
- **Changed the behavior of data display in the Depth of Market widget.** Now, data is displayed in static mode.
This means that the price series is fixed, while the current price moves within, above, or below the designated range.
To center on the current price, click the centering button (<svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 18 18" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M3.57821 9.5C3.81565 12.1079 5.89214 14.1843 8.5 14.4218V16H9.5V14.4218C12.1079 14.1843 14.1843 12.1079 14.4218 9.5H16V8.5H14.4218C14.1843 5.89214 12.1079 3.81565 9.5 3.57821V2H8.5V3.57821C5.89214 3.81565 3.81565 5.89214 3.57821 8.5H2V9.5H3.57821ZM8.5 6V4.58337C6.44491 4.81345 4.81345 6.44491 4.58337 8.5H6V9.5H4.58337C4.81345 11.5551 6.44491 13.1866 8.5 13.4166V12H9.5V13.4166C11.5551 13.1866 13.1866 11.5551 13.4166 9.5H12V8.5H13.4166C13.1866 6.44491 11.5551 4.81345 9.5 4.58337V6H8.5Z" fill="#131722"/></svg>) or use the *Shift + Alt/Option + C* shortcut.
Previously, centering was applied dynamically.
- **Renamed the Symbol Info dialog.** The _Symbol Info_ dialog and the corresponding items in context menus are called _Security Info_ now. [#8444](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8444)
- **Renamed ErrorCallback to DatafeedErrorCallback.** `ErrorCallback` used in `IDatafeedChartApi` has been renamed to `DatafeedErrorCallback`.
- **Updated `selectedCurrency` behavior.** In `CurrencyInfo`, the [`selectedCurrency`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.CurrencyInfo#selectedcurrency) property now returns `null` instead of `"Mixed"` when price scales contain mixed currencies.
- **Deprecated property.** The `brokerConfig` property in the [`TradingTerminalWidgetOptions`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.TradingTerminalWidgetOptions) interface is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
Use the [`broker_config`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.TradingTerminalWidgetOptions#broker_config) property instead.

**New Features**

- **New Custom themes API.** This API allows you to customize colors of the chart elements including toolbars, dialogs, and buttons.
To do this, you should specify your own theme with a custom color palette.
For more information, refer to the [Custom themes API](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization/styles/custom-themes) article.
- **Added Volume Candles chart style.** This chart style allows for a visual assessment of the volume of trades for each candle. These are still candlesticks, but the width of each candle depends on the volume of trades during the period of formation of this candle. The greater the trading volume during the formation period of the candle, the larger the width of the candle.
To display Volume Candles, select the corresponding option in the drop-down menu on the top toolbar.

**Improvements**

- **Behavior change for `chartContextMenuActions`.** When the [`chartContextMenuActions`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerWithoutRealtime#chartcontextmenuactions) method returns an empty array, the _Trade_ item within the chart [context menu](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/context-menu) will not be displayed. Previously, the item was rendered but grayed out. `Trading Platform Only`
- **Added the `library_custom_fields` property to the `LibrarySymbolInfo` interface.** This property is used to include additional metadata in the symbol information. The metadata will not be processed by the library.
- **Added extra properties to `symbolExt` method.** The [`symbolExt`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#symbolext) method now returns additional properties including `ticker`.
- **Added the `debug_broker` option to the Widget Constructor.** When [`debug_broker`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.TradingTerminalWidgetOptions#debug_broker) is specified, the library logs calls and responses to [`IBrokerWithoutRealtime`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerWithoutRealtime) and [`IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost) in the browser console. You can set `debug_broker` to one of the debug levels defined by [`BrokerDebugMode`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/modules/Charting_Library#brokerdebugmode). `Trading Platform Only`
- **Updated the anchored VWAP drawing.** Add bands settings to the anchored VWAP drawing.
- **Added new methods to the Trading Host.** The `getOrderTicketSetting` and `setOrderTicketSetting` methods have been added to the [`IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost) interface. These methods allow you to read and adjust Order Ticket settings. `Trading Platform Only`
- **Changed `const enum` to `enum` in the library type declarations.** This change allows you to import enums from the library in a TypeScript environment with the [`isolatedModules`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#isolatedModules) option enabled, such as when using Vite or similar tools.
- **Added the `hideStudiesFromLegend` option to `ClientSnapshotOptions`.** When `hideStudiesFromLegend` is set to true, the legend within the generated screenshots won't contain any studies applied to the chart.
- **Exposed `connectionStatusUpdate` from `IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost`.** An existing [`connectionStatusUpdate`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost#connectionstatusupdate) API has been exposed for [`IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IBrokerConnectionAdapterHost) to help reflect connection status changes throughout the application lifecycle. `Trading Platform Only`
- **New keyboard shortcuts.** The following [shortcuts](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/configuration/Shortcuts) were added:
  - _Shift_ + _Mouse wheel_  — scroll the chart horizontally
  - _Shift_ + _Alt_ + _B_ — place limit order to buy
  - _Shift_ + _Alt_ + _S_ — place limit order to sell
- **Enabled in-place editing for drawing texts.** For the following drawings, users can now add custom text and edit it on the chart:
  - _Fib Retracement_
  - _Trend-based Fib Extension_
  - _Horizontal_ and _Vertical Line_
  - _Trend Line_
  - _Info Line_
  - _Ray_
  - _Extended Line_
  - _Signpost_
  - _Note_
  - _Anchored Note_
  - _Comment_
  - _Rectangle_
  - _Ellipse_
  - _Circle_

  To enter the text, users should click the _+Add text_ placeholder that appears on hover.
- **Disabled color pickers in Chart settings.** If a certain price label or line is hidden on the chart, users cannot adjust the color of this label/line in the _Chart settings_ dialog.
- **Time zones.** Time zone updates:
  - Changed the Almaty (UTC+6) time zone to Astana (UTC+5).
  - Added the new Kuala Lumpur (UTC+8) time zone.
- **Visibility of price labels for risk-reward drawings.** Previously, price labels for the _Long position_ and _Short position_ drawings could be either hidden entirely or always displayed.
Now, if the price labels are disabled for a certain drawing, the labels will be displayed when the drawing is selected.
- **Accessibility improvement.** Users can now select the following elements in the _Legend_ when navigating with the keyboard.
  - The _More_ (<svg width="16" height="4" viewBox="0 0 16 4" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><circle cx="2" cy="2" r="1.5" stroke="currentColor"/><circle cx="8" cy="2" r="1.5" stroke="currentColor"/><circle cx="14" cy="2" r="1.5" stroke="currentColor"/></svg>) button and items in the corresponding menu
  - The _Remove_ (<svg width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 18 18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M7.5 4a.5.5 0 0 0-.5.5V5h4v-.5a.5.5 0 0 0-.5-.5h-3ZM12 5h3v1h-1.05l-.85 7.67A1.5 1.5 0 0 1 11.6 15H6.4a1.5 1.5 0 0 1-1.5-1.33L4.05 6H3V5h3v-.5C6 3.67 6.67 3 7.5 3h3c.83 0 1.5.67 1.5 1.5V5ZM5.06 6l.84 7.56a.5.5 0 0 0 .5.44h5.2a.5.5 0 0 0 .5-.44L12.94 6H5.06Z" fill="currentColor"/></svg>) button
- **Added new multiple-chart layouts combinations.** `Trading Platform Only`
- **New style settings for the note drawing.** Now:
  - The _Background_ and _Border_ settings are optional.
  - The default color of the drawing depends on the current chart [theme](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/customization#theme).

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed the _Pivot Points Standard_ compatibility with Japanese chart types.** The _Pivot Points Standard_ indicator used to cause the _Assertion failed: data must have unique sorted times_ error when applied to chart types such as Line Break, Renko, Kagi, and Point-and-Figure under certain data conditions.
- **Workaround for corrupted chart layouts.** In rare cases, chart layouts can become corrupted and cause a _DEFAULT_SYMBOL is not defined_ error when loaded by the library. To work around this error, set [`symbol`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.ChartingLibraryWidgetOptions#symbol) to be used as a fallback for any corrupted charts.
- **Fixed an issue where 0-volume data were not displayed in the Legend.** [#8662](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8662)
- **Fixed the time indicator.** The time indicator now correctly moves across the timeline in the [Market Status](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Symbol-Status) pop-up.
- **Fixed resizing for risk-reward tools.** The resizing of _Long position_ and _Short position_ drawings works correctly now. [#8513](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8513)
- **Fixed changing of drawing coordinates.** The setting dialog used to crash when users changed coordinates of drawings such as _Anchored Volume Profile_, _Fixed Range Volume Profile_, and _Regression Trend_.
- **Fixed the drawing settings bug.** Previously, when users clicked _Hide/Show_ on a drawing, the settings applied to this drawing would override the default ones. Now, changing drawing visibility does not affect the default settings. [#8434](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8434)
- **Fixed colors of the scale buttons.** The colors of the _A_ (auto) and _L_ (log) scale buttons match the chart background color now. [#8459](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8459)
- **Fixed bugs on the multiple-chart layout.** `Trading Platform Only` The following bugs were fixed:
  - The _Long/Short Position_ drawing used to cause errors if the drawing was hidden for a certain resolution and that resolution was currently displayed on the chart.
  - Synchronized _Path_ and _Polyline_ drawings were not displayed on larger resolutions if the first two points of the drawing were set at the same level on a smaller resolution.
  - The _Curve_ and _Double Curve_ drawings used to cause errors if a user moved the drawing before enabling layout synchronization.
  - Changing the Profit/Stop level of the synchronized _Long/Short Position_ drawing used to cause errors if the drawing was hidden for a certain resolution and that resolution was currently displayed on the chart.

**Documentation**

- **Updated types for overrides.** The following categories of overrides within the
[`ChartPropertiesOverrides`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.ChartPropertiesOverrides)
have been added or updated:
  - Added types for the Step line chart style (`mainSeriesProperties.steplineStyle.*`).
  - Updated the types for `paneProperties.*`.
  - Added overrides that affect Trading Platform features (`tradingProperties.*`).
- **New articles.** Explore our latest articles:
  - [How to create a custom indicator](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/tutorials/how-to-guides/create-custom-indicator) — a step-by-step tutorial that demonstrates the Moving Average implementation.
  - [Custom indicators. Inputs](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/custom_studies/metainfo/Custom-Studies-Inputs) — an overview of how to specify and manage input parameters for a custom indicator.

## Version 27.006

*Date: Tue May 21 2024*

**Bug Fixes**

- **Resolve quotes with ticker instead of symbol name.** The library will now request quote data using the [`ticker`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LibrarySymbolInfo#ticker) property. If `ticker` is not provided in the `LibrarySymbolInfo` object, the `name` property will be used instead. This should resolve an issue some customers were experiencing where quote data was not being properly displayed in the [Watchlist](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/Watch-List) and [Legend](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Legend).

## Version 27.005

*Date: Tue May 07 2024*

**Improvements**

- **Update the anchored AVWAP drawing.** Add bands settings to the anchored VWAP drawing.
- **Subscribe to widget bar visibility events.** A new [`study_event`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.SubscribeEventsMap.md#study_event) type was added: `widgetbar_visibility_changed`. It returns the visibility state of the widget bar.

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed a bug in the Market Status pop-up.** [Corrections](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/time-and-sessions/Extended-Sessions#corrections-for-extended-sessions) specified for the extended session in the [`session-correction`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LibrarySubsessionInfo#session-correction) properties were not displayed in the _Market Status_ pop-up window.

## Version 27.004

*Date: Wed Apr 17 2024*

**Breaking Changes**

- **Fixed time parameters in CrossHairMovedEventParams.** In version 26.001, we changed the `time` property of [`CrossHairMovedEventParams`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.CrossHairMovedEventParams) to be a timestamp in the selected time zone.
In this version, we reverted that change, and `time` represents a UTC timestamp again. Additionally, we introduced a new [`userTime`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.CrossHairMovedEventParams#usertime) property that represents a timestamp in the selected time zone.

**Improvements**

- **Added ability to disable pulse animation when chart type is set to Line.** New _disable_pulse_animation_ featureset allows users to disable the pulse animation when chart type is set to Line.

**Bug Fixes**

- **Fixed the price scale placement.** The [price scale](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/ui_elements/Price-Scale) should be placed back to its original position when a change made through the _Settings_ dialog is canceled. Fixes [#4991](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/4991)
- **Fixed the 52 Week High/Low indicator issue.** The 52 Week High/Low indicator no longer adds an empty space to the price scale when less than 52 weeks of historic bars are available. Fixes [#8137](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8137) [#8469](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8469)
- **Only calculate VWAP value when entire anchor period is loaded.** The VWAP indicator will only calculate values for the input anchor period if all bars in that period have been loaded.
- **Fixed a trailing stop modification dialog error.** Fixed a problem where opening the Order Ticket for a trailing stop position caused a "ReferenceError: isPositionLikeItem is not defined" error to be thrown.
- **Fixed the incorrect point position for the long position drawing.** The `getPositionPoints()` method will now return correct point positions. Fixes [#8230](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8230)
- **`BREAKING CHANGE` Position line price label does not use the correct price formatter.** The price scale will now correctly reflect the value when a formatter is used with [`createPositionLine`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createpositionline).
Both [`createOrderLine`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createorderline) and [`createPositionLine`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartWidgetApi#createpositionline) methods behave similarly to the corresponding actions made in the UI via [Order Ticket](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/order-ticket).
Fixes [#8413](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8413) [#8324](https://github.com/tradingview/charting_library/issues/8324)

**Documentation**

- **New User accounts article.** Refer to [User accounts](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/account-manager/user-accounts) for information on how to manage user accounts in the [Account Manager](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/account-manager).
- **Session documentation updates.** The [Symbology](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/Symbology#session) and [Extended sessions](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/connecting_data/time-and-sessions/Extended-Sessions) articles now include more information on how to specify sessions and corrections for them.
- **New Save user settings article.** Refer to the [Save user settings](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/saving_loading/user-settings) article for information on how to store user settings.
- **Updated Watchlist article.** Explore our latest [Watchlist](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/trading_terminal/Watch-List) article that describes how to customize and handle the watchlist's data.

## Version 27.003

*Date: Thu Mar 14 2024*

**Improvements**

- **Added the resetLayoutSizes method.** Use [`resetLayoutSizes`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartingLibraryWidget#resetlayoutsizes) to reset the sizes of all charts within a multiple-chart layout back to their initial default values. `Trading Platform Only`
- **Added the unloadUnusedCharts method.** The [`unloadUnusedCharts`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.IChartingLibraryWidget#unloadunusedcharts) method deletes non-visible charts from a multiple-chart layout. Use this method to
prevent the library's inherent behavior to restore previously displayed charts instead of creating new
charts when changing layouts. `Trading Platform Only`
- **Added a new type that reflects the ID of the created indicator.** A new [`study_event`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.SubscribeEventsMap.md#study_event) type was added: `create`. It returns the `id` of the newly created indicator.

**Bug Fixes**

- **Displaying volume indicator on chart load when visible_plots_set is not specified.** The chart will now correctly display the volume indicator if the `create_volume_indicator_by_default` featureset is enabled even if the symbols [LibrarySymbolInfo](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LibrarySymbolInfo) doesn't specify the optional [`visible_plots_set`](https://www.tradingview.com/charting-library-docs/latest/api/interfaces/Charting_Library.LibrarySymbolInfo#visible_plots_set) property.
